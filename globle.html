<h1>Global Game Remix</h1>
<p>This project is a remake of the game Globle by Trainwreck Labs. I am working on a project inspired by the game Globle <a href="https://globle-game.com”>Globle</a>. In Globle, there is a new Mystery Country to guess every day. You try to figure out which country it is by guessing, and the game shows you how close you are with colors on a globe. The hotter the color, the closer you are to the right answer.</p>
